# Challenge: Enhancing CI/CD for Web Product Development

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, you will be presented with two web application scenarios where essential parts of CI/CD are missing. Your task is to identify the shortcomings and propose solutions to introduce CI/CD practices effectively, tailored to the requirements of each web product.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform
A development team is working on an e-commerce platform that allows sellers to list products, and customers to browse, add items to their carts, and make purchases. Additionally, the platform needs to perform frequent analysis of different types of target customers to personalize their shopping experience. 

The team has successfully implemented continuous integration to run tests on every code commit. However, they face challenges in efficiently deploying new features and updates to the live website while ensuring seamless customer analysis.

### Scenario 2: Travel Media Website
A development team is building a travel media website where multiple writers use a Content Management System (CMS) to create, update, and delete posts simultaneously. The team uses version control and has set up a remote repository for the website's code. However, they rely solely on manual code reviews, which sometimes results in code inconsistencies, conflicts, and publication delays.

## Deliverables
Provide a clear and concise document as one markdown file that addresses both examples. Tailor your explanations and proposed solutions specifically to the e-commerce platform with customer analysis and the travel media website development. Your document should not require any coding and can utilize visual aids like flowcharts or diagrams to enhance clarity.

## Expected Time Limit
You have 30 minutes to complete this challenge. Focus on providing detailed and coherent explanations for your proposed CI/CD solutions within the given time frame.

## Note to Learners
Consider the unique requirements and characteristics of each web product while proposing CI/CD solutions. Demonstrate your understanding of how CI/CD principles can be applied effectively to enhance the development process for these specific web products. Good luck!
